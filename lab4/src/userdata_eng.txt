The Grand Canyon, one of the Seven Woonders of the Natural World is located in the state of Arizona
also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Formed by over 70 million years of erosion from the Colorado River
the Grand Canyon offers a spectacular view. The canyon spans 277 miles in length, up to 18 miles in width
and it measures over a mile in depth at its deepest points. Carlos always wanted to visit the Grand Canyon
and recently he received the chance to hike some of the trails and take several panoramic photographs during his visit
